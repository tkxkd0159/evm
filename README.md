# EVM

## Language
* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/stable/): Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
* [Yul](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#evm-dialect): Yul is an intermediate language that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends. It can be used in stand-alone mode and for *inline assembly* inside Solidity(`assembly { }`). The compiler uses Yul as an intermediate language in the IR-based code generator.
* [Huff](https://docs.huff.sh/): Huff is a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Huff does not hide the inner workings of the EVM and instead exposes its programming stack to the developer for manual manipulation.
